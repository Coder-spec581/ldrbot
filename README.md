A Telegram bot designed to streamline and gamify the experience of solving LinkedIn's daily puzzles  
(currently, [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens), [Tango](https://www.linkedin.com/games/tango), and [Zip](https://www.linkedin.com/games/zip)).

Each Telegram group acts as its own competition, where everyday members submit their puzzle results via screenshots. The bot processes them using OCR to maintain scoreboards and
rankings.

## 🤖 Try It Out

👉 Add the bot to your Telegram group: [@LinkedInGamesTrackerBot](https://t.me/LinkedInGamesTrackerBot)

Each group is treated as a standalone competition — just invite the bot to your group, `/start` it, and you’re ready to go!

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you add the bot to a Telegram group, that group becomes its own independent leaderboard and competition space. Each day, members of the group can submit their results for
LinkedIn’s puzzles (currently: Queens, Tango, and Zip) by simply uploading a screenshot of their completion screen.

The bot automatically scans these screenshots using OCR (powered by Tesseract) and extracts the relevant information: the game type and the time it took to solve it. Once
submitted, your time is recorded for the current day and associated with your Telegram username.

As group members submit their scores, the bot keeps track of who’s already participated and waits for everyone to submit. Once all registered players have sent their times, the bot
automatically recalculates and publishes the daily leaderboard. Alternatively, any member can run the /daily command to manually trigger a recalculation at any time.

If not everyone submits, the bot will still calculate and publish the results at the end of the day, including only the times that were received. This ensures the competition
continues smoothly even if someone forgets to post their score.

Each group maintains its own isolated set of scores, players, and competition history — meaning users can participate in multiple groups independently. Leaderboards reset daily, so
every new day is a fresh challenge for members to compete, improve, and (hopefully) brag.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- A Telegram account
- A Telegram group where you have permission to add bots

### Setup

1. **Invite the bot to your group**  
   The bot will start tracking scores and players from the moment it's added.

2. **Run `/start`**  
   This initializes your interaction with the bot (can be done privately or in group).

3. **Run `/join` (optional)**  
   Registers you in the group manually. Members are also automatically registered the first time they submit a valid screenshot or are added to the group after tracking begins.

4. **Submit your LinkedIn puzzle screenshot**  
   Send a screenshot of your completed puzzle. The bot will process and register your time for the current day.

5. (Optional) **Manage your score**  
   Use `/delete`, `/deleteall`, or `/override` (admin-only) to modify the results if needed. Useful for correcting misprocessed or mistaken submissions.

6. (Optional) **Track the competition**  
   Use `/daily` to recalculate and view the group leaderboard for the day.
7. **Wait for the group**  
   When all members are done (or at the end of the day) they leaderboard gets recalculated and shown in the group.
